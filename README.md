# Regina Garfias
### Cybersecurity & Risk Analytics | MSc Business Analytics

I am interested in structural uncertainty — how complex systems behave under stress, how vulnerabilities emerge, and how hidden dependencies shape outcomes.
My work focuses on modeling risk rigorously and translating detection into strategic decision-making.

I am particularly drawn to:

- Behavioral anomaly detection  
- Financial risk diagnostics  
- System fragility and regime shifts  
- Attack surface and vulnerability modeling  
- Risk-adjusted decision frameworks

I am motivated by understanding not just what happens in a system, but why it breaks — and what should be done about it.

## Direction

Designing resilient systems where detection, modeling, and decision-making converge in high-stakes environments.

## Philosophy

Security is not only technical — it is structural.
I am fascinated by how systems fail, how incentives distort behavior, and how data reveals hidden patterns.
My long-term goal is to build advisory frameworks that strengthen cyber resilience in high-stakes environments.
